<h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>
<p class="summary">I'm dedicated to building a better world through data and innovation. Currently, I’m creating analytical and operational tools in civictech and fintech.</p>
<h4>Co-Founder</h4>

<span class="dates">March 2017 &ndash; Present</span>
<p class="details">Code for Democracy is a civic technology lab that fights disinformation and dark money through innovations in data engineering.

<h3>Data Science for Good</h3>
<p class="summary">From fighting for civil liberties to working with the largest impact investor in the world, I believe in leveraging data to create structural and systemic change that unlocks opportunity for all people.</p>
<h4>Data Scientist & Policing Reform Expert</h4>
<a class="link" href="https://www.aclu.org/" target="_blank">American Civil Liberties Union</a><br />
<span class="dates">May 2017 &ndash; August 2019 (2 years 4 months)</span>
<p class="details">The ACLU engages in litigation to defend the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States. I supported the econometrics expert for <i>Collins v. Milwaukee</i>, a Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment case challenging the stop-and-frisk practices of the city’s police department, and sifted through the city’s data, ran statistical models, created data-driven reforms, and managed the economic consulting firm. Our 119-page report was crucial in negotiating the resulting $3.4M settlement and 5-year consent decree. As part of the agreement, Milwaukee will move towards evidence-based and bias-free policing with the help of an independent monitor.</p>
<ul class="fa-ul details"><li><i class="fa fa-li fa-link"></i><a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police-practices/stop-and-frisk-settlement-milwaukee-lawsuit" target="_blank">Stop-and-Frisk Settlement in Milwaukee Lawsuit Is a Wakeup Call</a></li></ul>
<h4>Data Scientist & Innovation Policy Consultant</h4>
<a class="link" href="http://worldbank.org" target="_blank">World Bank</a><br />
<span class="dates">October 2014 &ndash; July 2018 (3 years 10 months)</span>
<p class="details">The World Bank seeks to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity by committing $50B+ in loans, grants, equity investments, and guarantees to developing countries every year. I led a team of data scientists in the Innovation Labs and the FCI, T&C, and ICT global practices tackling a $400M+ multi-region policy portfolio aimed at cultivating communities of entrepreneurs and creating sustainable growth through innovation. Our approach utilized geospatial and multi-entity dynamic graph data and combined techniques from natural language processing, network analysis, and computational social science in order to inform $150M+ in operational components.</p>
